SimpleGit - A simple git client based on libgit2
================================================

The original source comes from 
 https://github.com/vfr-nl/git2/
(thanks to Vincent van Ravesteijn and Motiejus Jak≈°tys)
It then has been forked to
 https://github.com/Romain-Geissler/git2.git
 https://github.com/chris-y/git2.git
and is currently developed under
 https://github.com/sba1/simplegit.git
with a mirror at
 https://git.gitorious.org/amiga-ports/git2-amiga.git
 
Note that the call forwarding to the original git for unknown
options has been removed as the goal is to implement all
important commands natively.

The major target platform in this fork is AmigaOS4 but other
platforms are equally important as this eases testing. 

Building SimpleGit for AmigaOS
==============================

Currently, it only is possible to compile SimpleGit via a cross
compiler and CMake. See http://sourceforge.net/projects/adtools/
how to get the cross compiler environment.

Once everything is set up, building SimpleGit is as easy as typing

 $ make -f makefile.aos4

in the shell command prompt. Snapshot builds are available from
 https://sonumina.de/jenkins/job/git.amiga/

Building SimpleGit for other platforms
======================================

Among other stuff, CMake is needed to build the tool. Then type

 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update
 $ make

Testing on other platforms
==========================

If you want to test git2 with the tests of the original git, run:

 $ make test

on a POSIX-compatible operating system. This can take a lot of time (it
compiles git and then launch thousands of tests). As we are using the git
test framework, nearly all what can be done with git test can be done with
our test base (ie set GIT_SKIP_TESTS or GIT_TEST_OPTS).

You can run a particular test by giving its name:
 $ make -C tests t0000-basic.sh
