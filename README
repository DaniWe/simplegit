A VERY minimal git client that relies on libgit2.
======================

The original source comes from https://github.com/vfr-nl/git2/
(thanks to Vincent van Ravesteijn and Motiejus Jak≈°tys)

For every commands (including tricky options and switchs) that
we do not support (yet), the call is forwarded to the usual "git"
(found in PATH) and thus git2 is completely transparent for
users and works exactly as git do.


Building git2
======================

After git-cloned you need to initialise the submodules :
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
This can take a lot of time (it clones libgit2 and git repository).

Then you can compile with :
    $ make


Testing
======================

If you want to test our git client with the tests of git, run :
    $ make test
This can take a lot of time (it compiles git and then launch thousands of tests).
