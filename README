A VERY minimal git client that relies on libgit2.

The original source comes from https://github.com/vfr-nl/git2/
(thanks to Vincent van Ravesteijn and Motiejus Jak≈°tys)

For every commands (including tricky options and switchs) that
we do not support (yet), the call is forwarded to the usual "git"
(found in PATH) and thus git2 is completely transparent for
users and works exactly as git do.
