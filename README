Git2 - A VERY minimal git client based on libgit2
=================================================

The original source comes from 
 https://github.com/vfr-nl/git2/
(thanks to Vincent van Ravesteijn and Motiejus JakÅ¡tys)
It then has been forked to
 https://github.com/Romain-Geissler/git2.git
 https://github.com/chris-y/git2.git
and is currently developed under
 https://github.com/sba1/git2
with a mirror at
 https://git.gitorious.org/amiga-ports/git2-amiga.git
 
Note that the call forwarding to the original git for unknown
options has been removed as the goal is to implement all
important commands natively.

The major target platform in this fork is AmigaOS4 but other
platforms are equally important as this eases testing. 

Building git2 for AmigaOS
=========================

Currently, it is only possible to compile git2 via a cross
compiler and CMake. See http://sourceforge.net/projects/adtools/
how to get the cross compiler environment.

Once everything is set up, build git2 is as easy as typing
 > make
in the chell command prompt.

Testing
=======

If you want to test git2 with the tests of the original git, run:
 > make test
On a POSIX computer. This can take a lot of time (it compiles git and then launch
thousands of tests). As we are using the git test framework, nearly all what can
be done with git test can be done with our test base (ie set GIT_SKIP_TESTS or
GIT_TEST_OPTS).

You can run a particular test by giving its name :
 > make t0000-basic.sh
