Import the parse options code from git that might be very
powerful.

Write please_git_help_me so that we can fallback to git when we
can't achieve the job.

Import some git functionnalities to libgit2 (on a new branch) :
	- find current git directory (currently hold through a call
	  to please_git_help_me)
	- find an oid from one of its prefix

Rewrite git-init and git-log currently self executable to be used
by the main dispatcher (on the git model).

Feel free to add any ideas here !
